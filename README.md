## Internationalization (Multi-language Support)

- To add more languages, update the translation files in Django and the frontend.

- **README Documentation:** This file provides setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean Code:** Modular JavaScript, semantic HTML, and organized CSS.
- **User Experience:** Friendly error messages, smooth navigation, and clear feedback.
- **Security:** No sensitive data in codebase; environment variables for secrets.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML and accessible forms.
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated analytics and tests via GitHub Actions.
